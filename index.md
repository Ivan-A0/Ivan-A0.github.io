I am a Computer Science major planning to graudate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6 part 1

    This was my favorite lab because it was the point where I truly started understanding the work and the use of different data types. The different lines of code and its intended purpose to get your desired outcome. It is also where we started to use slightly more complex lines of code and commands to create the programs, which spread from part 1 & 2. It is also where I ran into my first major issue of troubleshooting and fixing logic errors, so I would say it was the most informational lab for me.

Lab 7

    This is my second favorite lab because I was able to understand the lab and almost complete it on my own. It gave me slight issues which taught me different ways to write a line of code to get the same result. It was another highly information lab for me which helped me better grasp the concepts we were learning. 
	
Lab 2
    This is my third favorite lab because looking back at it with what I know now it seems so easy. When I first worked on this lab I was not sure what we were doing and it was the lab that introduced me to the start of Computer Science. I feel like it is great to see where we started and seeing what we know now, building the foundation of our future career.
